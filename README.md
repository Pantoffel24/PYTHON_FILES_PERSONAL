# PYTHON_FILES_PERSONAL
The purpose of this repository is to simply store a bunch of python programs more focused around physics applications and data orientated things

Majority of these files work in tandem with other physics reports, so the context may not always be given when examining the python files on there own. Most of these make use of matplotlib, pandas, and if it was needed, numpy
